# javaExample
example programs to be studied
They are labeled by week as you can do one each week, and they are simple programs that show off certain Java methods
You can use this for self-study and to trace to see how the program works. It makes for good practice as I made it slighty messy with some codes 
this will be updated on the occasion with a new lesson which will show off more simple methods. I plan to add something for multi-dimensional arrays&use of UML& more
examples of how methods() can be used along with constructors
