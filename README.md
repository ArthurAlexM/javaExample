example programs to be studied
They are labeled by week as you can do one each week, and they are simple programs that show off certain Java methods
You can use this for self-study and to trace to see how the program works. It makes for good practice as I made it slighty messy with some codes 
this will be updated on the occasion with a new lesson which will show off more simple methods. I plan to add something for multi-dimensional arrays&use of UML& more
examples of how methods() can be used along with constructors

UPDATE 12/22/20: Hangman.zip has been added and it contains a sample program of Hangman. The Hangman program can be traced but also needs another method to be used/added 
In order for the user to be able to win the game. There also remains 1 other logical error that invovles guessing the same letter again. WHEN YOU UNZIP HANGMAN, BE SURE TO HAVE WORDS.TXT IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS THE PROGRAM.
